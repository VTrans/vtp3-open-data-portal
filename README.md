There seems to be a problem with the Open Data Portal for ArcGIS Online
Here is an issue discussing the problem on GeoNet 
https://geonet.esri.com/thread/107927
Waiting on reply from French @ Esri

They acknowledged the issue as a bug, however they donâ€™t know exactly what dataset elements cause it during harvesting.  The recommendation was to try publishing as a hosted feature service in ArcGIS Online to test, and serve temporarily while the fix is developed (expected 2-3 weeks).   

Can you test the data (or subset) with a hosted service and report back?  That will help our teams nail down the issue.
